Usage
-----
```
# install flask, request, twilio libraries, get Twilio number (if you want the info texted to you)
# TODOs...
# ./app.py, to test: curl -d "Body=[INSERT STOCK SYMBOL]" -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/sms
# to setup text response w/ Twilio: expose Python app w/ a public URL, configure number to make HTTP request to 
>> your URL
```

TODOs
-----
* Add buy/sell/hold recommendations for trending stocks
* Ask user for Alpha Vantage API key instead of using mine
* Create alt solution: script that runs periodically, checking for "buy" signals based on technical indicators
* Task queue library to allow user to set up notifications, such as price target

What it does
------

Current: user requests stock price via POST request to [Alpha Vantage API](https://www.alphavantage.co/) and the app returns today's stock price and RSI. User can request multiple stock prices in a single message.

Future: more useful info than just stock price, task queue library for notifications, a script for personal use
